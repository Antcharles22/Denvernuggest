                The range of remarkable ways Nikola Jokic dominates basketball games is unparalleled. He’s the NBA’s most supportive superstar, happy to share the ball, allergic to monopolizing a system that revolves around his decision-making. Jokic’s passes are deliberate genius, anticipatory and dizzying—from lobs out of a pick-and-roll, to 75-foot-long touchdowns, to no-look slingshots that buzz through the paint.

              As a scorer, Jokic’s floaters, turnarounds, and putbacks are nearly automatic. His jumper comfortably extends to 25 feet. His post-ups and isolations (which he does about as infrequently as Saddiq Bey) are a choose-your-poison nightmare. But the root of all Jokic’s success can be found in the subtle moments that prelude those exclamation points. When he’s without the ball, coming off a screen, Jokic transforms into the sport’s most singular player. It’s here where the two-time MVP distinguishes himself, while simultaneously grounding and lifting one of the most efficient offenses of all time.

              The center position is continuously evolving. Pace, space, and myriad factors have altered the value and responsibility big men hold on any given possession. Jokic’s identity is as someone who flourishes ahead of the curve. To guard him away from the ball is to accept a challenge unlike anything basketball has ever seen from a 7-footer. When Jokic comes off a screen, the defense can’t help but lean on its heels. There’s a constant guessing game, dealing with tactics that are methodical, camouflaged, chaotic, and transparent at the same time. No center is less predictable, which is why no center is harder to stop.

              “You can’t prepare for every situation because you don’t know where he’s going to be,” Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla says. “He could be on the left block, he could be on the right block, he could be at the nail … that level of creativity and randomness makes it very difficult to guard him, and it’s cool that he embraces that.”
